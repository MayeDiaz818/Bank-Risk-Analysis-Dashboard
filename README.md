# 💳 Financial Risk Analysis Dashboard  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project focuses on **Bank Risk Analysis**, aiming to evaluate the probability of a client representing a financial risk for the bank.  

It addresses key questions such as:  
- Will the customer default on a loan?  
- Does the client have enough assets to cover liabilities?  
- Is the financial behavior stable or risky?  
- What is the exposure across financial products?  

By answering these questions, financial institutions can make better decisions on:  
- Loan approvals  
- Credit card limits  
- Customer loyalty strategies  
- Interest rates & loan conditions
